# blockchain_ledger_system

## Background
This application builds a blockchain-based ledger system using streamlit module in python.

## Usage
This ledger allows financial institution to conduct transactions (that is, to transfer money between senders and receivers) and to verify the integrity of the data in the ledger.

## Technologies
 * [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) - turns data scripts into shareable web apps

 * [typing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) - defines a standard notation for Python function and variable type annotations.

 * [hashlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html) - This module implements a common interface to many different secure hash and message digest algorithms. Included are the FIPS secure hash algorithms SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, and SHA512 (defined in FIPS 180-2) as well as RSAâ€™s MD5 algorithm (defined in Internet RFC 1321).
